But I love it  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"},{"sys":{"id":"2pKZjTq1o861r1a37NuEHn","created_at":"2019-06-20 20:25:59 +0000","updated_at":"2019-09-19 12:34:06 +0000","content_type_id":"item","revision":5},"name":"Margaux's crochet cream top","main_color":"white","image":{"sys":{"id":"71t1YWzNB7AQuu5ubQK0BE","created_at":"2019-08-06 04:03:58 +0000","updated_at":"2019-08-06 04:03:58 +0000"},"title":"IMG 0565","description":null,"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/4sf3k05ydnj7/71t1YWzNB7AQuu5ubQK0BE/5bd6da11cf4f4d90dc9274ee608565f1/IMG_0565.png"},"category":"Shirt","color":["#F6F1E9"],"brand":"Judith & Charles","price_range":"Free","vintage":false,"when":"2018-12-20 00:00:00 +0000","notes":"Margaux gave me this as a hand me down.
